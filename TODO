Add a referendum type that only allows _one_ (or n) referendum(s) to
go through in the categoy and then "closes" the category.

Add printout of largest area (compared to breakpoint) in
subcategories.

Allow sorting of sub-categories.

Simplify URLs to referendums and laws.

Add a simple markup for referendum content that includes a simple URN
format for linking to laws and referendums. Proposal:
urn:ref:CATEGORY/REFERENDUM, or urn:law:CATEGORY/LAW, e.g
urn:ref:cabinet.commonwealth.britain/1324 and
urn:law:laws.commonwealth.britain/4711/

Add graphical diagrams of vote-sum-changes.

There is no anonymity in the database (a DB administrator can
compromize anonymity). To solve this is rather compelex, because you
need to know what votes to cancel when disabling a user in a
referendum. Proposed solution:

  Store the plain-text password in RAM while a user is logged in.

  Use a hash-function from the password (with a different salt from
  the ones used to store it in the suers table, possibly a different
  for each referendum) as user id in the vote table for a referendum.

  Never cancel a vote, or decrease the number of "active users" for an
  on-going referendum, i.e. voting rights are given on a referendum by
  referendum basis, and are never revoked for a referendum allthough
  the right to change ones' vote can be revoked (and is revoked at the
  same time ones' right to vote in new referendums is revoked).

  To add extra security, the user password might not be saved in RAM,
  but a hash, that is again hashed for every referendum.
