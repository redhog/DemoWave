# DemoWave

DemoWave is a web-application for conducting referendums that

 * Allows anyone to propose a new referendum.
 * Minimizes the negative effects of people "spamming" the system with bogus referendums.
 * Makes referendums where people disagree a lot take longer time to go through.

In addition, it can manage a set of laws and referendums on changes to those laws.

## Credits

DemoWave was written by RedHog (Egil MÃ¶ller) with support from
Max Lundkvist in form of comments, ideas and discussion.

Testing has been performed by members of the Swedish green
party.

The voting model used by DemoWave was first developed by
members of the Swedish direct democracy party (however, the author
of DemoWave is in no way affiliated with this group any longer).

Please see help/index.LANGUAGE.html for information on how to install,
configure and use DemoWave.
