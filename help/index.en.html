   <h1 id="about">About DemoWave</h1>

   <p>DemoWave is a web-application for conducting referendums that

    <ul>

     <li>Allows anyone to propose a new referendum.</li>

     <li>Minimizes the negative effects of people "spamming" the
     system with bogus referendums.</li>

     <li>Makes referendums where people disagree a lot take longer
     time to go through.</li>

    </ul>

    In addition, it can manage a set of laws and referendums on
    changes to those laws.

   </p>

   <p>
    <h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>

    <p>DemoWave was written by RedHog (Egil Möller) with support from
    Max Lundkvist in form of comments, ideas and discussion.</p>

    <p>Testing has been performed by members of the Swedish green
    party.</p>

    <p>The voting model used by DemoWave was first developed by
    members of the Swedish direct democracy party (however, the author
    of DemoWave is in no way affiliated with this group any longer).</p>

   <p>
    <h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

    <ul>

     <li>Install PostgreSQL and Install PHP</li>

     <li>Untar the DemoWave tgz package to a directory in your website
     structure (and if not already enabled, enable execution of PHP
     scripts within this directory in your webserver
     configuration).</li>

     <li>If you are running PHP version 4.x you must install
     PHP_Compat <tt>pear install PHP_Compat</tt></li>

     <li>Install php-pgsql <tt>apt-get install php4-pgsql php4-gd</tt></li>

     <li>Download and untar <a
     href="http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/chart/chart-manual.php">Chart</a>
     inside the DemoWave directory. Symlink chart to chart-VERSION.</li>

     <li>Download and untar <a
     href="hhttp://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/php-gettext">Chart</a>
     inside the DemoWave directory. Symlink php-gettext to
     php-gettext-VERSION.</li>

     <li>Create a PostgreSQL user and database for DemoWave using the
     PostgreSQL tools <tt>createuser</tt> and <tt>createdb</tt>. Make
     sure to grant all rights for the database to the newly created
     user.
      
      <ul>
       <li><tt>createuser $USERNAME</tt></li>
       <li><tt>createdb $DATABASENAME</tt></li>
       <li><tt>createlang plpgsql $DATABASENAME</tt></li>
       <li><tt>psql -c "alter role $USERNAME password '$PASSWORD';"</tt></li>
       <li><tt>psql -c "grant all on database $DATABASENAME to $USERNAME;"</tt></li>
      </ul>
     </li>

     <li>Run the command <tt>cat demowave.tables.sql
     demowave.views.sql demowave.initial-data.sql | psql -h localhost
     $DATABASENAME $USERNAME</tt> from within the DemoWave
     directory.</li>

     <li>Edit the file config.php to correspond to how you set up your
     PostgreSQL database.</li>

     <li>If you want integration with FUDforum
      <ul>

       <li>Install FUDforum and create a new forum for the referendum
       discussions</li>

       <li>Go to said forum in the FUDforum main view. Your URL will
       be something along the lines of
       <tt>FUDforum2/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=2</tt>. In this
       example, 2 is your forum ID.</li>

       <li>Select the Members menu and click on admin. Your URL will
       be something like <tt>FUDforum2/index.php?t=usrinfo&id=34</tt>.
       In this example, 34 is your user ID.</li>

       <li>Edit the file config.php to correspond and set the forum
       id, user id, the URL and the paths to the FUDforum files to
       their correct values.</li>
      </ul>

     <li>Run the command <tt>./compiletranslations.sh</tt> from within
     the DemoWave directory, at least if you want any other language
     than english.</li>

     <li>Using a webbrowser, go to the URL corresponding to the
     DemoWave installation directory and log in as user admin,
     password admin.</li>

     <li>Adding users to the system can be done under the "Register"
     menu, and users can be given the right to vote under the "Account
     management" menu. Don't forget to change your password under "My
     settings"!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="help">Getting help</h2>

    <p>Throughout the DemoWave application, there is context help
    available by clicking on the <span class='help'>?</span> symbol
    next to the item you need to know more about.</p>
   </p>

   <p>
    <h2 id="voting-model">About the voting model</h2>

    <p>DemoWave uses a voting model that allows anyone to propose a new
    referendum, and where minorities can get their voice heard, while
    effectively hindering "referendum spam" - large amounts of referendum
    proposals inserted by a malicious user to overwhelm other users and
    prevent them from finding the relevant referendums.</p>

    <p>This is accomplished by factoring in time in the voting process
    - the more people who vote the same in a referendum, the quicker the
    referendum is completed. A referendum can still be completed with only
    one vote, or with half the voters save one voter against (these two
    cases are handled the same by the system), but it will take
    considerably longer time than a referendum where evryone agrees.</p>

    <p>
     <h3 id="current-vote">Your current vote</h3>

     <p>At every point in time, your vote in a referendum can be either
     "yes", "no" or "no vote cast" (indescissive), represented by the
     numbers 1, -1 and 0 respectively.</p>

     <p>You can change your vote at any time, and it will from then on
     stay the same until you decide to change it again</p>

     <p>At the beginning of a new referendum, everyones' vote is "no vote
     cast".</p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <h3 id="current-vote-sum">Current sum of everyones' votes</h3>

     <p>This is the sum of all votes in a referendum at any given time,
     divided by the number of eligable voters at that time.</p>

     <p>Since all votes are between 1 and -1 and there are no more
     votes than voters, this value is also in the range of 1 to -1.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
     <h3 id="vote-sum">Total vote-sum</h3>

     <p>This is the sum over time of all <a
     href="#current-vote-sum">current vote sums</a>, or, votes times
     time.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <h3 id="breakpoint">Breakpoint</h3>

     <p>Short version: If everyone votes "yes", this is the amount of
     time it takes for the referendum to go through. Example: 5 days 3
     hours means that it takes 5 days and 3 hours for a descission that
     everyone votes in favor of to go through.</p>

     <p>If the <a href="#vote-sum">total vote sum</a> reaches the
     breakpoint value, the referendum goes through, and if it reaches
     minus the breakpoint value, the referendum is dismissed.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <h3 id="start">Start</h3>

     <p>The time at which the referendum was first entered into the system.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <h3 id="completed">Completed/Estimate</h3>

     <p>The time at which the proposal was passed or rejected if the
     referendum is completed, or the time at which the referendum will
     complete unless someone changes his/her vote.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <h3 id="example">Example referendum</h3>

     <img src="graph.reject.png" alt="Example voting graph" />

     <p>The above graph shows the <a href="current-vote-sum">vote
     sum</a> changes over time for an example referendum that is about
     to get rejected.</p>

     <p>The graph was generated at about 18:32 (the point where the
     dark red field ends).</p>

     <p>The dark red field is the <a href="#vote-sum">total
     vote-sum</a> which fills the area from where the graph crossed
     the x-axis the last time until the current time.</p>
     
     <p>The light red area is the current estimated <a
     href="#vote-sum">total vote-sum</a> up until the estimated <a
     href="#completed">completion time</a>. If no one changes his/her
     vote before that, the referendum will end with a rejection at
     about 18:44.</p>

     <p>The first vote was cast at about 18:22, and was a "yes" vote.
     Thereafter, other "yes" votes dropped in, until about 18:24, when
     people started changing their minds and previous "yes" votes
     where changed into "abstain" or plain "no" votes, or new "no"
     votes dropped in, until 18:26 the majority changed to a
     rejection.</p>

     <p>Just before 18:29 someone voted "yes" again (or a "no" vote
     was changed into "abstain"). After that, not much happened until
     about 18:31 when two people voted "no" (or a "yes" vote was
     changed into a "no" vote).<p>

    </p>
   </p>

   <p>
    <h2 id="referendum-details">Referendum details</h2>

    <p>
     <h3 id="categories">Categories</h3>

     <p>All referendums are sorted into categories, where all referendums
     in a certain category shares some common properties, e.g. they
     may all be over a certain type of questions, or the decisions may
     all be carried out by the same executive body.</p>

     <p>
      <h4 id="categorypath">Category paths</h4>

      <p>Categories can have sub-categories, which in turn can have
      sub-categories. To designate a particular sub-category of a
      particular category, paths, very similar to paths in the
      filesystem of a computer, are used. Path-entries are separated
      by dots (.). For example, the sub-category for decisions
      concerning the Murraylands College of the sub-category for
      Schools of the category for South Australia might have the path
      'SA.School.Murraylands'.</p>

     </p>
    </p>

    <p>
     <h3 id="referendum-type">Referendum types</h3>

     <p>There are three types of referendums - referendums on texts,
     referendums on laws and referendums on categories. All
     referendums in the same category are of the same type.</p>

     <p>
      <h4 id="referendum-type-text">Text</h4>

      <p>Each referendum on a text consists of that text, and it is up
      to the description of the category to tell how that text is
      supposed to be used once the proposal is passed.</p>
     </p>

     <p>
      <h4 id="referendum-type-law">Law</h4>

      <p>A category of referendums on laws contain a set of laws made
      up of paragraphs of texts. Each referendum might add, change or
      remove such paragraphs.</p>
     </p>

     <p>
      <h4 id="referendum-type-category">Category</h4>

      <p>Referendums on addition or removal of categories specify all
      the parameters for that category, namely the path for the new
      category, the type of referendums for referendums in the
      category, and the breakpoint.</p>

   <h1 id="doc-license">GNU Free Documentation License</h1>

   <p>Version 1.2, November 2002</p>

   <pre>   Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</pre>

   <p><strong>0. PREAMBLE</strong></p>

   <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
   other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
   freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
   redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially
   or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the
   author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
   being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p>

   <p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
   derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
   same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is
   a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>

   <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
   free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
   free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
   that the software does. But this License is not limited to software
   manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
   matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend
   this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
   reference.</p>

   <p><strong>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</strong></p>

   <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
   that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
   be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice
   grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
   to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The
   "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of
   the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the
   license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
   requiring permission under copyright law.</p>

   <p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
   the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>

   <p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
   section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
   relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
   Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
   nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
   (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
   Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
   relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
   subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
   philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p>

   <p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
   titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
   notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
   If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
   is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may
   contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify
   any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p>

   <p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
   listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License. A
   Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
   be at most 25 words.</p>

   <p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
   copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to
   the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
   of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
   available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
   formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
   suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
   Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
   been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
   readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if
   used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not
   "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p>

   <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
   plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
   format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
   standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
   human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include
   PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
   can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
   XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
   available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
   produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p>

   <p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
   itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
   the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For
   works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
   Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
   work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>

   <p>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
   whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
   following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
   stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
   "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
   To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
   Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
   to this definition.</p>

   <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
   which states that this License applies to the Document. These
   Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
   this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
   implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
   has no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>

   <p><strong>2. VERBATIM COPYING</strong></p>

   <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
   applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
   add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You
   may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
   or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However,
   you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you
   distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
   conditions in section 3.</p>

   <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
   above, and you may publicly display copies.</p>

   <p><strong>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</strong></p>

   <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
   have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
   the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
   and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
   front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
   equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
   covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
   long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
   conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>

   <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
   adjacent pages.</p>

   <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
   numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
   Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
   each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
   network-using public has access to download using public-standard
   network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
   of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
   reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
   copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
   remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
   year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
   through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
   public.</p>

   <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
   of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
   copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
   version of the Document.</p>

   <p><strong>4. MODIFICATIONS</strong></p>

   <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
   under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
   release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
   Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
   distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
   possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in
   the Modified Version:</p>

   <ul>
    <li><strong>A.</strong> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
    from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
    of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
    if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</li>
    <li><strong>B.</strong> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
    Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
    Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
    unless they release you from this requirement.</li>
    <li><strong>C.</strong> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
    Modified Version, as the publisher.</li>
    <li><strong>D.</strong> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</li>
    <li><strong>E.</strong> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
    adjacent to the other copyright notices.</li>
    <li><strong>F.</strong> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
    terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</li>
    <li><strong>G.</strong> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</li>
    <li><strong>H.</strong> Include an unaltered copy of this License.</li>
    <li><strong>I.</strong> Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
    to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
    there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
    given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
    Version as stated in the previous sentence.</li>
    <li><strong>J.</strong> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
    public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
    the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
    it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
    You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
    least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
    publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</li>
    <li><strong>K.</strong> For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
    and/or dedications given therein.</li>
    <li><strong>L.</strong> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
    unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
    or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</li>
    <li><strong>M.</strong> Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
    may not be included in the Modified Version.</li>
    <li><strong>N.</strong> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</li>
    <li><strong>O.</strong> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
   material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
   some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their
   titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
   license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other
   section titles.</p>

   <p>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
   contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
   various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the
   text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
   definition of a standard.</p>

   <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
   and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
   the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage
   of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document
   already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
   by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
   behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
   one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
   the old one.</p>

   <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
   License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
   assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>

   <p><strong>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</strong></p>

   <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
   this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
   modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
   of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
   unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
   combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
   their Warranty Disclaimers.</p>

   <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
   and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
   single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same
   name but different contents, make the title of each such section
   unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
   original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
   unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
   the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
   combined work.</p>

   <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
   "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
   Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
   "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You
   must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."</p>

   <p><strong>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</strong></p>

   <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
   rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
   in all other respects.</p>

   <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
   a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.</p>

   <p><strong>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</strong></p>

   <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
   separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
   copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
   legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
   works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
   License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
   are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p>

   <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
   these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
   half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
   placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or
   the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
   electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that
   bracket the whole aggregate.</p>

   <p><strong>8. TRANSLATION</strong></p>

   <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
   4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
   Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
   include the original English version of this License and the
   original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
   disagreement between the translation and the original version of
   this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
   prevail.</p>

   <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
   "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
   Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
   actual title.</p>

   <p><strong>9. TERMINATION</strong></p>

   <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other
   attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
   License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
   you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
   long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

   <p><strong>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</strong></p>

   <p><span>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
   versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   <a
   href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</a>
   </span></p>

   <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
   number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
   version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
   have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
   that specified version or of any later version that has been
   published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
   choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
   Software Foundation.</p>

   <p><strong>How to use this License for your documents</strong></p>

   <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a
   copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright
   and license notices just after the title page:</p>

   <pre>   Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
   Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
   under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
   or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
   with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
   Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
   Free Documentation License".</pre>

   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
   Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</p>

   <pre>   with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
   Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</pre>

   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some
   other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to
   suit the situation.</p>

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code,
   we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice
   of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
   to permit their use in free software.</p>
